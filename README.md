# Snake
Hi!
This is a simple HTML5 based snake game with AI.
You can try it [here](https://dulongsang.github.io/Snake/), have fun!

## Algorithms
I implemented 3 AI algorithms. I will brief you on each algorithm in this section.

### Simple Greedy
For each step, the program computes the manhattan distance of each neighbour of the snake's head,
it will take the neighbour with the least manhattan distance and without crashing with any part
of the body as the next step.

### Shortest Path
The program computes the shortest path from the snake's head to the food and follows this path.

### Hamiltonian Cycle
To be implemented.
